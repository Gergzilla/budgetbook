# pybudget

My attempt at creating my own budgeting software in python

## Overview

This is my attempt at expanding my knowledge of python and other components in order to create a tool for budget and expense reporting for myself.  And because I found available tools to be frustrating and using google sheets is boring

## Goals

I expect the end state to be able to:

- Import transactions from common file formats (CSV for now)
- Compile this data into a single file for simplicity
- Allow custom labelling or tagging for budget and expense categories
- User friendly interface for validating and correcting import issues
- Provide a nice UI for viewing transactions, reports, summaries and charts
- System can be run on a private hosted web system with minimal footprint

Future roadmap:

- secure login capabilities for data protection
- extend support for other file formats such as PDF
- A possible desktop client alternative with GUI
- use a database like SQLite to store all transaction data for more robust options
